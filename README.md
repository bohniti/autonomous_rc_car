## Abstract
For our group IT-project at the \textit{University of Applied Science Georg Simon OHM}, we built an autonomously driving remote control car. To accomplish this project, we used the framework DonkeyCar. Supervised learning is the primary component, but we provide related work and projects to compare this project with the state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning. We explain how to connect the car with the microcontrollers and cables, to do a full reverse-engineering on the project. Every single component will be introduced in an appropriate complexity for non-electrical-engineers.  The neural network is a VGG16-Network, which will be explained with all details and parts to understand the networks' architecture fully. We further provide information about how the car can be driving with the webserver. The Report gives a detailed explanation of the API and the transferred data.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks, Presentation and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/Mavengence/Autonomous-RCCar-IT-Project-TH.OHM.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Of course you need git to get the source
- If you want to compile the report or the presentation by ur self u need a LaTex Compiler for your OS and maybe an IDE which makes things easier
- If you want to compile, train and play with our Code you need a python working environment. We used Jupyter Notebooks. The requiered packeges you can see in the Notebooks itself.
- For Prerequisites of our Project Hompage check the Website itself. There you willl find a detailed description of how to contribute changes to website. 

### Run the Notebook

```
cd/you_cloned_repo_location jupyter notebook
```

### Deployment

Just pull the repo, if you wanna change sth you can ask :)
